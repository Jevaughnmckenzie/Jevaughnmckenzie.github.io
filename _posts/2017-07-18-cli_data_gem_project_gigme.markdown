So after many, many days of coding and self-induced anxiety brought on by extended bouts of procrastination, I finally managed to finish my first portfolio project as a part the Flatiron School’s Online Web Development bootcamp course. As much as it was a lot of hard work, I did enjoy putting my newly developed coding powers and actually creating a fairly complex ruby program. Naturally, I think I went a little overboard with the project. I believe that Flatiron only required that the cli scrape a web page one or two levels down, but I ended up going about four levels deep. Maybe I’m a masochist. Who can say? Nevertheless, the program works, and I am happy with it.

The CLI I created is called Gigme. It scrapes the New York section of Craigslist and allows a user to search for gigs (very short-term jobs) based on location and job type. I limited the application to New York for simplicity sake, (LOL it still wasn’t simple at all) but you still got access to nearby areas like New Jersey and Connecticut.

The biggest takeaway from this project has been reaffirmation that I am totally capable of being a software engineer. Sure, it’s hard, the hours are long, and the learning curve is steep, but I can do it, and I will do it.
