		I think I’m finally becoming more comfortable with starting projects. In the past, I would often spend countless hours staring at a blinking cursor, facing the crippling anxiety that I have come to accept as the norm. Not this time though. This time I knew exactly how I wanted to start my task managing app. 
What has always tripped me up in the past was a simple lack of planning. I knew that if I wanted to get this project working as soon as possible, I would need to know exactly what this app would do before I wrote a single line of code. That way, I wouldn’t need to stop countless times during the coding process to think about what else I need to add. Since I managed to have Juggler fully functional in under three days, I think it's safe to say that my plan worked. I won’t even consider building another app without planning it out first.
Juggler is a very simple task management app that allows a user to sign up with their own account and create, edit, and delete projects that they would like to work on. Projects can be labeled as active or inactive depending on whether or not they are a priority for the user at the moment. Also, each project can have an unlimited number of tasks that the user creates. Task are, for the time being, extremely simple and only allow you to give them a name and the amount of time you wish to spend on them. Tasks can also be edited and deleted, of course.
This was a really fu project for me to work on because I tend to juggle a lot of personal projects at one time. I’d like to develop this app into something more sophisticated that I can actually use in the future.
