<p>I'm a numbers guy turned photographer, turned web developer who's always looking to soak up some new knowledge. As a recent grad of Stony Brook University, I thought my next best move would be to get a firm grasp on programming since its been an on and off hobby for a while. Not sure where it will take me, but I can't wait to find out.</p>
